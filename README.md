		- from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
		- from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfTransformer 
		- from sklearn import svm, datasets
		- from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score, precision_score, recall_score

### Step 2 : Create a folder IMDb, Save the IMDb.ipynb in the same folder along with the following files 

		- imdb_test_pos.txt
		- imdb_test_neg.txt
		- imdb_train_pos.txt
		- imdb_train_neg.txt
